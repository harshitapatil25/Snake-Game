# Snake-Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a classic snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, you control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The objective is to make the snake as long as possible without running into the walls or itself. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right).
